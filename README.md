# Natural Language Processing applied to Music

Using Natural Language Processing concepts with Python to analyze music lyrics.

## Summary

This project uses NLP concepts such as Naive Bayes, Text Classification, Supervised Machine Learning, and Laplace Smoothing to create language models based off the lyrics of many songs. The project is currently coded entirely using raw Python, meaning only basic Python libraries such as the `math` and `random` libraries are used. In the future, I plan to build on this project, using different (and more sophisticated) concepts to analyze music and evaluate performance between different models.

## Usage
### Requirements
Although this project should be pretty flexible, it is not guaranteed to work without fulfilling these requirement.
1. `Python 3.10.11`: This project was developed and tested using Python 3.10.11.
2. `Linux-based shell`: Since the program prints output to the terminal, a shell that is able to run Python is needed. This project was developed on a Linux terminal.
3. `Significant computing power and memory`: ML tasks are known for using lots of memory and computing power. If on a home machine, the program might execute very slowly or run out of memory.
